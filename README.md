### Intro
This is a hobby game meant to try out Godot and make something fun. Others are welcome to contribute, especially
in making fun and interesting quests or even in adding additional maps to the game!

I've tried to keep the objectives as compatible as possible but with tens of thousands of combinations it's not
feasible to track. Report an issue if your game featured entirely incompatible objectives.
